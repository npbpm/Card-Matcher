# Card Matcher

This project was developed by a group of 5 people, myself included, it was done as a class project for our first year of Master's degree.

The idea with this project was to create an app that would allow the user to create a database of cards and then detect any other card comparing it to the database, the algorithm would use the SWING method then to go and match the card to the best match inside the database.
